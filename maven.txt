Maven Lifecycle
The default lifecycle comprises of the following phases

validate - validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available
compile  - compile the source code of the project
test     - test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed
package  - take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.
verify   - run any checks on results of integration tests to ensure quality criteria are met
install  - install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally
deploy   - done in the build environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.
